# DeckSwipe

A simple A/B choice card game. There are 4 gameplay stats (Coal, Food, Health, Hope), each contributing to the chances of the player's city's survival. Choices that the player makes through swiping each card left or right will influence those stats in various ways. If any one of the stats depletes (reaches zero), the game is lost and reset. The player's objective is to make decisions such that it doesn't happen and the city survives, for as long as they can manage.

The core mechanics and visuals are heavily based on Reigns, and its clone, Lapse: The Forgotten Future. The content is mostly inspired by Frostpunk and its neverending winter.

DeckSwipe is a codename; the game does not have a real name yet.

Created with Unity on Linux, primarily for the Android platform.
